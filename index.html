					<p>
						I am currently employed by Doctor Care Anywhere as an Azure DevOps Engineer, with prior
						experience as a Public Cloud Developer at Barclays and a Public Cloud SRE during my time at
						Lloyds Banking Group. Throughout these experiences I have gained invaluable experience and
						discovered my passion in the world of DevOps and Cloud Engineering. I have used tools such as
						Terraform, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, Microsoft Azure, AWS, Cloudformation, Chef, Helm, and
						Kuberentes. Additionally, I am currently undertaking a JavaScript Bootcamp at the University of
						Manchester in my spare time to further enhance my current skillset. I have a strong desire to be
						my personal best in every aspect of life and believe that this will give me the motivation and
						tenacity to become a successful engineer.

					<p>One of my first big projects using Javascript was Tic-Tac-Toe, a game which I made using HTML for
						the UI
						structure, CSS to make it look good
						and Javascript to handle the games logic. For more information on how I executed this project
						visit <a href="https://dev.to/bornasepic/pure-and-simple-tic-tac-toe-with-javascript-4pgn"

					<p>My intractive Javscript map has some similar dynamic attributes to Google Maps, such as the
						ability to
						zoom
						in and out of locations.
						The game will be made using Javascripts framework JQuery to help familiarise myself with one of
						the most
						widely used libaries of code. If you'd like to have a try, visit <a
